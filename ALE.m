%% Adaptive Line Enhancer (ALE) 
% This example shows how to apply adaptive filters to signal separation
% using a structure called an adaptive line enhancer (ALE).  In adaptive
% line enhancement, a measured signal x(n) contains two signals, an unknown
% signal of interest v(n), and a nearly-periodic noise signal eta(n).
%
% The goal is to remove the noise signal from the measured signal to obtain
% the signal of interest.

%% Loading the Signal of Interest
% We'll first load in a signal of interest, a short clip from Handel's
% Hallelujah chorus.

audioReader = dsp.AudioFileReader('handel.ogg','SamplesPerFrame',44100);
timeScope = dsp.TimeScope('SampleRate',audioReader.SampleRate,...
    'YLimits',[-1,1],'TimeSpan',1,'TimeSpanOverrunAction','Scroll');

while ~isDone(audioReader)
    x = audioReader() / 2;
    timeScope(x);
end

%% Listening to the Sound Clip
% You can listen to the signal of interest using the audio device writer.

release(audioReader); 
audioWriter = audioDeviceWriter;
while ~isDone(audioReader)
    x = audioReader() / 2;
    audioWriter(x);
end

%% Generating the Noise Signal
% Let's now make a periodic noise signal--a sinusoid with a frequency of
% 1000 Hz.

sine = dsp.SineWave('Amplitude',0.5,'Frequency',1000,...
    'SampleRate',audioReader.SampleRate,...
    'SamplesPerFrame',audioReader.SamplesPerFrame);

%%
% Now let's plot 10 msec of this sinusoid above.  It shows 10 periods in 10
% msec, just as it should.

eta = sine();
Fs  = sine.SampleRate;
plot(1/Fs:1/Fs:0.01,eta(1:floor(0.01*Fs)));
xlabel('Time [sec]');
ylabel('Amplitude');
title('Noise Signal, eta(n)'); 


%% Listening to the Noise
% The periodic noise is a pure tone. The following code plays one
% second (one frame of 44100 samples) of the noise signal.

eta = sine();
release(audioWriter);
audioWriter(eta);

%% Measured Signal
% The signal that we actually measure is the sum of these two signals, and
% we call this signal s(n). A plot of s(n) shows that the envelope of the
% music signal is largely obscured. Listening to a 3-second clip from the
% measured signal, the noise is clearly prominent...

release(audioReader);
release(timeScope);
release(audioWriter);
count = 1;
while count < 4
    s = (audioReader() / 2) + sine();
    timeScope(s);
    audioWriter(s);
    count = count + 1;
end

%% Adaptive Filter Configuration
% An adaptive line enhancer (ALE) is based on the straightforward concept
% of linear prediction.  A nearly-periodic signal can be perfectly
% predicted using linear combinations of its past samples, whereas a
% non-periodic signal cannot.  So, a delayed version of the measured signal
% s(n-D) is used as the reference input signal x(n) to the adaptive
% filter, and the desired response signal d(n) is made equal to s(n). The
% parameters to choose in such a system are the signal delay D and the
% filter length L used in the adaptive linear estimate.  The amount of
% delay depends on the amount of correlation in the signal of interest.
% Since we don't have this signal (if we did, we wouldn't need the ALE!),
% we shall just pick a value of D=100 and vary it later.  Such a choice
% suggests that samples of the Hallelujah Chorus are uncorrelated if they
% are more than about 12 msec apart.  Also, we'll choose a value of L=32
% for the adaptive filter, although this too could be changed.

D = 100;
delay = dsp.Delay(D);


%%
% Finally, we shall be using some block adaptive algorithms that require
% the lengths of the vectors for x(n) and d(n) to be integer multiples of
% the block length.  We'll choose a block length of N=49 with which to
% begin.

%% Block LMS
% The first algorithm we shall explore is the Block LMS algorithm.  This
% algorithm is similar to the well-known least-mean-square (LMS) algorithm,
% except that it employs block coefficient updates instead of
% sample-by-sample coefficient updates.   The Block LMS algorithm needs a
% filter length, a block length N, and a step size value mu.  How do we
% pick mu?  Let's start with a value of mu = 0.0001 and refine it shortly.

L  = 32;
N  = 49;
mu = 0.0001;
blockLMSFilter = ...
    dsp.BlockLMSFilter('Length',L,'StepSize',mu,'BlockSize',N);

%% Running the Filter
% The output signal y(n) should largely contain the periodic sinusoid,
% whereas the error signal e(n) should contain the musical information, if
% we've done everything right.  Since we have the original music signal
% v(n), we can plot e(n) vs. v(n) on the same plot shown above along with
% the residual signal e(n)-v(n).  It looks like the system is converged
% after about 5 seconds of adaptation with this step size. The real proof,
% however, is obtained by listening;

release(audioReader);
release(timeScope);
release(audioWriter);
while ~isDone(audioReader)
    x = audioReader() / 2;
    s = x + sine();
    d = delay(s);
    [y,e] = blockLMSFilter(s,d);
    timeScope(e);
    audioWriter(e);
end

%%
% Notice how the sinusoidal noise decays away slowly. This behavior is due
% to the adaptation of the filter coefficients toward their optimum values.

%% FM Noise Source
% Now, removing a pure sinusoid from a sinusoid plus music signal is not
% particularly challenging if the frequency of the offending sinusoid is
% known.  A simple two-pole, two-zero notch filter can perform this task.
% So, let's make the problem a bit harder by adding an FM-modulated
% sinusoidal signal as our noise source.

eta = 0.5 * sin(2*pi*1000/Fs*(0:396899)' + 10*sin(2*pi/Fs*(0:396899)'));
signalSource = dsp.SignalSource(eta,...
    'SamplesPerFrame',audioReader.SamplesPerFrame,...
    'SignalEndAction','Cyclic repetition');
release(audioReader);
release(timeScope);
release(audioWriter);
while ~isDone(audioReader)
    x = audioReader() / 2;
    s = x + signalSource();
    timeScope(s);
    audioWriter(s);
end

%%
% The "warble" in the signal is clearly audible.  A fixed-coefficient notch
% filter won't remove the FM-modulated sinusoid.  Let's see if the Block
% LMS-based ALE can.  We'll increase the step size value to mu=0.005 to
% help the ALE track the variations in the noise signal.

mu = 0.005;
%mu = 0.001;% Magnus test
release(blockLMSFilter);
blockLMSFilter.StepSize = mu;

%% Running the Adaptive Filter
% We now filter the noisy music signal with the adaptive filter and compare
% the error to the noiseless music signal.
release(audioReader);
release(timeScope);
release(audioWriter);
while ~isDone(audioReader)
    x = audioReader() / 2;
    s = x + signalSource();
    d = delay(s);
    [y,e] = blockLMSFilter(s,d);
    timeScope([x,e]);
    audioWriter(e);
end
